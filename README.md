This is not the final version of STDFormer. If you need to apply this code to your project, you need to add some additional packages. In addition, you also need to do the following things:
(1) Modify src/data according to the target characteristics of the data set;
(2) If you need to switch different heads of the model, you need to manually switch the code comments in src/models/STD.py.
